# Yet another DMZ cursor theme

The purpose of this theme is to replace the black/white busy spinner ![](https://github.com/GalliumOS/dmz-cursor-theme/blob/master/DMZ-White/pngs/24x24/watch_0001.png) in the DMZ cursor theme. All icons (except the animated watch spinner icon and the pointer) is inherited from the DMZ-White theme.

- I: For the blue **Unity8 dots** I have used [this YouTube video ](https://youtu.be/Dwxx2yQs_Ig?t=8m3s) as a reference. 
- II: This **Unity8 spinner** came from [the Ubuntu Phone documentation](https://docs.ubuntu.com/phone/en/apps/design/building-blocks/activity-indicators).
- III: The **orange split** is an orange dot splitting and assembling white rotating.
- IV: **DMZ-colored_trobber** is the standard default DMZ watch spinner, colored blue.

- The blue spinner looks great but can be difficult to locate on an orange background (which is shiped by default), so the **Unity8 dots with background** adds a white background. This is a solution, but doesn't look very good in practice.

The pointer has also been replaced and should appear sharper.
