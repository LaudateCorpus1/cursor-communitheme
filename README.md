# Yet another DMZ cursor theme

The purpose of this theme is to replace the black/white busy spinner ![](https://github.com/GalliumOS/dmz-cursor-theme/blob/master/DMZ-White/pngs/24x24/watch_0001.png) in the DMZ cursor theme. All icons (except the animated watch spinner icon) is inherited from the DMZ-White theme.

### Installation 
To give this a try simply copy the folder to `/usr/share/icons/` and select the cursor theme is Tweaks.

Todo / Known issues:
- The animation is not 100% identical to the blue spinner.
- The blue spinner is very similar to the one used on Windows. Discuss creating something unique that fits with the Ubuntu brand.
