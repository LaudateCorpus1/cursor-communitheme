# Yet another DMZ cursor theme

The purpose of this theme is to replace the black/white busy spinner ![](https://github.com/GalliumOS/dmz-cursor-theme/blob/master/DMZ-White/pngs/24x24/watch_0001.png) in the DMZ cursor theme. All icons (except the animated watch spinner icon and the pointer) is inherited from the DMZ-White theme. I've used [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/Dwxx2yQs_Ig?t=8m3s) of Unity8 as a reference.

The pointer has also been replaced and should appear sharper.
