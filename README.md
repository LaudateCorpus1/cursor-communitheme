# Yet another DMZ cursor theme

The purpose of this theme is to replace the black/white busy spinner ![](https://github.com/GalliumOS/dmz-cursor-theme/blob/master/DMZ-White/pngs/24x24/watch_0001.png) in the DMZ cursor theme. All icons (except the animated watch spinner icon and the pointer) is inherited from the DMZ-White theme. 

- For the blue **Unity8 dots** I have used [this YouTube video :fa-film:](https://youtu.be/Dwxx2yQs_Ig?t=8m3s) as a reference. 
- The blue spinner looks great but can be difficult to locate on an orange background (which is shiped by default), so the **Unity8 dots with background **adds a white background.
- The **orange split** is an orange dot splitting and assembling white rotating.
- **DMZ-colored_trobber** is the standard default DMZ watch spinner, colored blue

The pointer has also been replaced and should appear sharper.
