# Yet another DMZ cursor theme

The purpose of this theme is to replace the black/white busy spinner ![](https://github.com/GalliumOS/dmz-cursor-theme/blob/master/DMZ-White/pngs/48x48/watch_0001.png) in the DMZ cursor theme.

To give this a try simply copy the folder to `/usr/share/icons/` and select the cursor theme is Tweaks.

Known issues:
- All icons (except the animated watch spinner icon) is inherited from the DMZ-White theme, but in GTK3 application the DMZ-Black cursor is inherited.
- The animation is not 100% identical to the suru spinner in the icon theme.
- The Suru spinner is very similar to the one used on Windows. Discuss creating something unique that fits with the Ubuntu brand.
